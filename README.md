This library is intended to simplify the use of LCD displays for the visualization of sensors data. At this moment only LCD with 320x240 pixels is supported, but the library can be modified for other display types as well. 
Visualization has two modes: digital and chart. Additionally night and day modes are supported as well. The switch between modes is implemented by the use of touch functionality.
If measured values are exceed the threshold values corresponding sensor window changes itï¿½s background color.
The library is build up as a kind of window library with support of touch functionality and can be used for general purpose tasks.
To start try SensorsMonitor example. The sensors in this example are working in the demo mode and only LCD has to be properly connected.
